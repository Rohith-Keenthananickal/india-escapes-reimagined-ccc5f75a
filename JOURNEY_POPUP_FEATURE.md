## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
const [showFirstPopup, setShowFirstPopup] = useState(false);
const [showSecondPopup, setShowSecondPopup] = useState(false);
const [isTransitioning, setIsTransitioning] = useState(false);
const [showDateFilter, setShowDateFilter] = useState(false);
const [journeyStartDate, setJourneyStartDate] = useState<Date | undefined>();
const [journeyEndDate, setJourneyEndDate] = useState<Date | undefined>();
```

### Persistence
